# Tasks & Config Functions

Tasks are actions that are conducted in sequence when the Install-SitecoreConfiguration cmdlet
is called. A task is implemented as a PowerShell cmdlet.
Each task is identified by a unique name and must contain a Type property. 

Config functions allow elements of the configuration to be dynamic, letting you calculate values, invoke
functions, and pass these values to tasks so that a configuration can be flexible.
